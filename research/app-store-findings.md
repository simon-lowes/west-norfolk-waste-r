# UK Bin Collection Apps - App Store Research

**Research Date:** 5 February 2026
**Researcher:** Claude Code Agent
**Purpose:** Competitive analysis for West Norfolk Waste App

---

## Executive Summary

This research analysed 15 UK bin collection and waste management apps available on the Apple App Store. Key findings reveal significant opportunities in the market:

### Key Patterns Observed

1. **Two App Categories Exist:**
   - **Generic/Manual Setup Apps** (e.g., Bin Day Alert, Bin Collection Reminder): Users manually configure bin types and schedules. Higher ratings but require more setup effort.
   - **Council-Specific Apps** (e.g., Leeds Bins, Sheffield Bins, Edinburgh Bins): Auto-fetch schedules from council data. More convenient but limited to specific areas.

2. **Rating Distribution:**
   - Top performers achieve 4.6-4.8 stars with simple, reliable functionality
   - Lowest rated apps (1.9-2.0 stars) suffer from technical issues and poor UX
   - Council-specific apps average 3.1-4.6 stars, often plagued by data sync issues

3. **Most Valued Features:**
   - Push notification reminders (evening before collection)
   - Calendar integration
   - Simple, clean interface
   - Widget support (iOS home screen)
   - Apple Watch support

4. **Major Pain Points (Opportunities for Us):**
   - Apps crashing or forgetting user settings
   - Data not updating for new calendar years
   - Flats/shared bins not supported
   - Confusing interface design
   - Excessive permission requests
   - Notifications arriving at wrong times or not at all
